This is just a txt file in which a summary of the first chapter of Jesse Liberty's book 
 Git for Programmers. 

Main things to remeber 

1) you create a file 
2) git add <file> 
3) git commit -m "description"
4) git push so that all repositories acquire the the document 

*****if you are at the command line, and IDE, or GIt Desktop use git pull to acquire the updates 
You should not commit all the time, but you should use the stash. 

What is the stash? 
The git stash it was takes your staged changes both commited and uncommited. The stash saves this staged changes for later use and then reverts them from your working copy. Remeber that uncommitted changes in the stash will not be uploaded to remote repositories.

Make sure that the commit comments are good. Otherwise you might have more fun eating glass. 

#Commit messages *******
